    gomsurveyplot.py:   This program creates the sky heatmap plot from the GomSpace survey data. 
    
    input:         A CSV file containing the sky survey data generated by the survey program provided by GomSpace.
    output:        A heatmap plot of the input data. 
                   In the plot the elevation are tagged from 0 to 9 where 0 means 90 degree elevation and 9 means 0 degre elevation.
                   And all the middle values can be understood similarly. For tag value t the degree value of the elevation is (9-t)*10.  
                   Please consult the documentation to understand the mathematical basis of this plot.                   
     
    Usages:        To use the program run: python gomsurveyplot.py [inputfile name]
                   Replace [inputfile name] with our csv file names. 
    
    Prerequisites: This program is tested for python2.7 
                   You need the following libraries
                   
                   numpy     
                   Scipy
                   matplotlib 
                   
                   To install them on Debian or Ubuntu run:
                        
                        sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib 

                   Alternatively you can also use pip to install them. Please look up the internet for pip instructions.
                   
    Improvement opportunity: use binary search for sampling the final values for the polar skymap. (near line 200)
    
    Note:          some auxiliary files are created in the process of crating the final heat-map. They are a legacy of the development process. 
                   If you dont need or understand them then you can safely ignore them.
